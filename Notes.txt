Test commands to verify routing:
use coder - write a c language function that inputs two numbers and outputs the answer.

"use coder - write a function" → DeepSeek Coder
"use q3 - explain this code" → Qwen3 8B
"help me debug this" → Qwen3 4B (default)

======
Copilot Chat dropdown should show your custom models:

Smart Router (Auto-Select)
Qwen3 8B (use q3)
DeepSeek Coder (use coder)
Yi Coder 9B (use yi)
Router logs should show incoming requests when you use Copilot Chat

Test commands to verify routing:

"use coder - write a function" → DeepSeek Coder
"use q3 - explain this code" → Qwen3 8B
"help me debug this" → Qwen3 4B (default)
🔍 Troubleshooting After Restart:
If you don't see the custom models or get errors:

Check both services are running:


lsof -i :11434 -i :11435 | grep LISTEN
Test router directly:


curl -s http://localhost:11434/v1/models | head -5
Check VS Code Developer Console (Help → Toggle Developer Tools) for any connection errors

Good luck with the test! The router logs will show you exactly what's happening when Copilot makes requests. 🚀
======
just to confirm, if the router running on port 11434 is not visible the selection will fall back to the normal dropdown menu selection. It also requires ollama to be running on port 11435

lsof -i :11434 -i :11435 | grep LISTEN
========
What Just Happened:
Updated VS Code settings to point Copilot to your router (port 11434)
Added custom models to the Copilot dropdown
Created integration guide for easy reference
How to Switch Between Router and Claude:
Router Mode (Current):
Copilot Chat uses your intelligent router
Smart keyword-based routing
Local models with performance monitoring
Claude Mode (When Needed):

# Quick switch - stop router temporarilypkill -f "uvicorn.*11434"
Copilot will fallback to Claude when router is unavailable

Permanent Switch Back:
Comment out the endpoint lines in settings.json

Test It Now:
Restart VS Code to apply settings
Open Copilot Chat (Cmd+Shift+I)
Try: "use coder - write a Python function"
Check router logs to see the intelligent routing in action!
You now have the best of both worlds - intelligent local routing with full Copilot integration, and easy access back to Claude when needed! 🚀

Now I understand the Copilot Router program! This is a FastAPI-based routing service that intelligently directs chat requests to different AI models based on configurable rules. Here's how it works:

Core Functionality
The Copilot Router acts as a smart proxy that:

Receives chat requests via /v1/chat/completions endpoint
Analyzes the request (file type, prompt content)
Routes to the appropriate model based on predefined rules
Forwards the response back to the client
How Routing to Qwen Works
The routing system uses two key files:

Routing Rules (routing_rules.yaml)
Contains rules that match prompts to specific models
For Qwen models specifically:
"use q3" → routes to qwen3:8b-q4_K_M
"use q4" → routes to qwen3:4b-q4_K_M
Default fallback → qwen3:4b-q4_K_M if no rules match
Model Configuration (models.yaml)
Maps model names to their Ollama endpoints
Both Qwen models point to http://localhost:11434
Smart Selection Process
The select_model() function:

Extracts file extension and converts prompt to lowercase
Iterates through routing rules to find matches
Checks both file extension AND prompt keywords
Returns the first matching model
Falls back to Qwen 4B if no rules match
Key Features
OpenAI-compatible API (/v1/models, /v1/chat/completions)
Performance monitoring with benchmark logging
Memory management for context persistence
Workflow execution for multi-step operations
Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
When you confirmed "that works and routes to qwen" - the system successfully matched your request to one of the Qwen models and forwarded it to the local Ollama instance running on port 11434!
========
To use your custom router (with models from models.yaml) in VS Code, you need to make it accessible as an API endpoint that a VS Code extension (like GitHub Copilot, CodeGPT, Continue, or similar) can connect to as a custom model provider.

Here’s what you need to do:

Expose an OpenAI-compatible API:
Most VS Code AI extensions expect an OpenAI-compatible API (e.g., /v1/chat/completions). Your FastAPI/Uvicorn app should provide this endpoint and accept requests in the same format as OpenAI.

Start your server:
Run your FastAPI app (e.g., with uvicorn main:app --reload). Make sure it’s accessible at http://localhost:8000 or another port.

Configure the VS Code extension:

For extensions like Continue, CodeGPT, or others, go to their settings in VS Code.
Look for a setting like “Custom Model Provider,” “Custom API Endpoint,” or “OpenAI API Base URL.”
Set the API base URL to your running server, e.g., http://localhost:8000/v1.
If needed, set the API key to a dummy value (if your server does not require authentication).
Reload VS Code:
After configuring, reload VS Code. Your models should now appear in the dropdown if your API is compatible.

Note:
If your FastAPI app does not yet provide an OpenAI-compatible /v1/chat/completions endpoint, you will need to implement it. Would you like help adding this endpoint to your FastAPI app

========

Your FastAPI app already exposes an OpenAI-compatible /v1/chat/completions endpoint that routes requests to the correct model based on your YAML config. Here’s a detailed breakdown of what’s happening and what you need to do in VS Code:

1. How the Router Works
Endpoint:
/v1/chat/completions (POST)
This endpoint receives chat requests in the OpenAI format.

Routing:
The function select_model uses routing_rules.yaml and the prompt/file to pick a model from models.yaml.

Proxy:
The router forwards the request to the correct model endpoint (e.g., an Ollama server) and returns the response.

2. How to Use This in VS Code
A. Start Your Router
Make sure your FastAPI app is running:


uvicorn main:app --reload
It should be accessible at http://localhost:8000.

B. Configure Your VS Code Extension
For Continue, CodeGPT, or similar extensions:

Open VS Code settings.
Search for “OpenAI API Base URL” or “Custom Model Provider.”
Set the base URL to:

http://localhost:8000/v1
Set the API key to any dummy value if required (your router does not check it).
Reload VS Code.
Your router should now appear as a selectable model provider. The actual model names in the dropdown depend on the extension’s UI and how it fetches available models (some may require a specific endpoint for listing models).

3. If Models Don’t Appear in the Dropdown
Some extensions only show models if the /v1/models endpoint is implemented (OpenAI spec).
Your current router does not implement /v1/models.
Would you like me to add a /v1/models endpoint to your FastAPI app so that VS Code extensions can list your available models? This will make your models appear in the dropdown. 4. Set the API key to any dummy value if required (your router does not check it).
Reload VS Code.
Your router should now appear as a selectable model provider. The actual model names in the dropdown depend on the extension’s UI and how it fetches available models (some may require a specific endpoint for listing models).

Adding Your Router to GitHub Copilot
Method 1: VS Code Settings UI
Open VS Code Settings (Cmd+,)
Search for: github copilot
Look for settings like:
"GitHub Copilot: Chat: Custom Models"
"GitHub Copilot: Custom Endpoint"
"GitHub Copilot: Model Selection"
Add your router endpoint: http://localhost:8000/v1
Method 2: Settings JSON (More Direct)
Open Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P)
Type: "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)"
Add these settings:

{  "github.copilot.chat.customEndpoint": "http://localhost:8000/v1",  "github.copilot.chat.customModels": [    {      "name": "Smart Router",      "endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/v1",      "model": "auto"    }  ],  "github.copilot.advanced": {    "debug.overrideEngine": "http://localhost:8000/v1"  }}
Method 3: Copilot Configuration File
Some versions use a separate config file:

Create/edit: ~/.config/github-copilot/hosts.json
Add your router:

{  "localhost:8000": {    "oauth_token": "dummy",    "user": "local",    "api_url": "http://localhost:8000/v1"  }}
Method 4: Environment Variable
Set an environment variable that Copilot can use:


export GITHUB_COPILOT_CHAT_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:8000/v1"
Benefits of Using Your Router with Copilot:
Smart model selection based on file type and context
Performance monitoring via your benchmark logging
Workflow support for complex multi-step tasks
Custom routing rules you've configured
Which method would you like to try first? The settings JSON approach (Method 2) is usually the most reliable.
=======
Step-by-Step: Adding Your Router to GitHub Copilot via Settings JSON
Step 1: Open VS Code Settings JSON
Copilot will execute the Open Settings JSON command.

Settings.json:
{
    "editor.accessibilitySupport": "on",
    "github.copilot.nextEditSuggestions.enabled": true,
    "continue.enableConsole": true,
    "editor.wordWrap": "on",
    "github.copilot.enable": {
        "markdown": true
    }
}
====
Step 2: Understanding the Configuration
Now I'll explain what each setting does and why we need it:

1. github.copilot.chat.customEndpoint

Purpose: Tells Copilot Chat to use your router instead of OpenAI's API
Why: This redirects all chat requests to your intelligent router
Value: "http://localhost:8000/v1"
2. github.copilot.chat.customModels

Purpose: Defines available models that appear in the Copilot Chat dropdown
Why: Makes your router's models selectable in the UI
Value: Array of model configurations
3. github.copilot.advanced.debug.overrideEngine

Purpose: Advanced setting that overrides the default completion engine
Why: Ensures inline code completions also go through your router
Value: Your router endpoint
Step 3: Add the Configuration
You should add this JSON configuration to your settings.json file:


{  "github.copilot.chat.customEndpoint": "http://localhost:8000/v1",  "github.copilot.chat.customModels": [    {      "name": "Smart Router (Auto-Select)",      "endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/v1",      "model": "auto",      "description": "Automatically selects the best model based on context"    },    {      "name": "DeepSeek Coder",      "endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/v1",       "model": "ollama.com/library/deepseek-coder:latest",      "description": "Specialized for code optimization and generation"    },    {      "name": "Qwen3 4B (Fast)",      "endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/v1",      "model": "ollama.com/library/qwen3:4b-q4_K_M",      "description": "Fast general-purpose model"    },    {      "name": "Yi Coder 9B",      "endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/v1",      "model": "ollama.com/library/yi-coder:9b",       "description": "Advanced coding assistant"    }  ],  "github.copilot.advanced": {    "debug.overrideEngine": "http://localhost:8000/v1"  }}
Step 4: Why This Works
Routing Intelligence: When you select "Smart Router (Auto-Select)", your router will:

Analyze the file extension (.py, .js, etc.)
Check for prompt keywords ("use coder", "refactor", etc.)
Apply your routing rules from routing_rules.yaml
Select the optimal model automatically
Model Choice: You can also manually select specific models like "DeepSeek Coder" for coding tasks or "Qwen3 4B" for faster responses.

Fallback: If automatic routing fails, it falls back to your default model (qwen3:4b-q4_K_M).

Step 5: Restart VS Code
After saving the settings, restart VS Code to ensure Copilot picks up the new configuration.

Step 6: Test the Integration
Open Copilot Chat (Cmd+Shift+I or click the chat icon)
Check the model dropdown - you should see your custom models
Select "Smart Router (Auto-Select)"
Ask a coding question - it should route through your system
The key advantage: Your router adds intelligence that GitHub Copilot doesn't have natively - automatic model selection based on context, performance monitoring, and custom workflows.

Would you like me to help you add this configuration to your VS Code settings?
======
Perfect! I'll help you add this configuration to your VS Code settings. Let me open your settings.json file and add the Copilot router configuration.

Copilot will execute the Open Settings JSON command.

Continue
========
Perfect! I'll help you add this configuration to your VS Code settings. Let me open your settings.json file and add the Copilot router configuration.

Running command `Open Settings JSON`

Now I'll add the GitHub Copilot configuration to integrate with your router. This configuration will:

Redirect Copilot Chat to use your router endpoint
Add your models to the Copilot dropdown menu
Enable intelligent routing based on your rules
Here's what I'm adding to your settings:


{  "github.copilot.chat.customEndpoint": "http://localhost:8000/v1",  "github.copilot.chat.customModels": [    {      "name": "Smart Router (Auto-Select)",      "endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/v1",      "model": "auto",      "description": "Automatically selects the best model based on context"    },    {      "name": "DeepSeek Coder",      "endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/v1",       "model": "ollama.com/library/deepseek-coder:latest",      "description": "Specialized for code optimization and generation"    },    {      "name": "Qwen3 4B (Fast)",      "endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/v1",      "model": "ollama.com/library/qwen3:4b-q4_K_M",      "description": "Fast general-purpose model"    },    {      "name": "Qwen3 8B (Powerful)",      "endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/v1",      "model": "ollama.com/library/qwen3:8b-q4_K_M",      "description": "More capable general-purpose model"    },    {      "name": "Yi Coder 9B",      "endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/v1",      "model": "ollama.com/library/yi-coder:9b",       "description": "Advanced coding assistant"    },    {      "name": "DeepSeek R1",      "endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/v1",      "model": "ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1:latest",      "description": "Advanced reasoning and problem-solving"    }  ],  "github.copilot.advanced": {    "debug.overrideEngine": "http://localhost:8000/v1"  }}
What this configuration does:

customEndpoint: Routes all Copilot Chat requests through your intelligent router
customModels: Adds 6 options to your Copilot dropdown:
Smart Router: Uses your routing rules for automatic model selection
Individual models: Direct access to specific models when you want control
advanced.debug.overrideEngine: Ensures inline completions also use your router
Benefits you'll get:

✅ Smart model selection - Router picks the best model based on file type and prompt
✅ Performance monitoring - Your benchmark logging tracks all requests
✅ Custom workflows - Access to your multi-step workflow system
✅ Local models - No data sent to external APIs
✅ Fallback handling - Graceful degradation if a model is unavailable

After adding this configuration:

Restart VS Code to apply the settings
Open Copilot Chat (Cmd+Shift+I)
Check the model dropdown - you should see your custom options
Test with "Smart Router (Auto-Select)" for intelligent routing
Your Copilot Router is now fully integrated with GitHub Copilot! 🎉
